# Delivery

### Objective: Deliver the weaponized payload to the target.

### Action:

1. Send the spoofed email to the target's email address.

2. The email may include a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document with a macro) or a link to a malicious website hosting the payload.

3. Use social engineering techniques to convince the target to open the attachment or click the link (e.g., "Urgent: Please review the attached document").
