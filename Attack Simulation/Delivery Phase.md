2. The email includes a link to a malicious website hosting the payload.

3. Use social engineering techniques to convince the target to open the attachment or click the link (e.g., "Urgent: Please review the attached document").

4. Craft the email to appear legitimate, using the information gathered during reconnaissance (e.g., impersonating a service the target uses).
