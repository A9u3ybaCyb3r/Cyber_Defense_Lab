# Command and Control (C2)
## Objective:
Establish a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.

## Techniques:
Utilizing covert channels (e.g., DNS tunneling, encrypted HTTPS traffic).
Employing C2 servers to issue commands and exfiltrate data.
ðŸ“Œ Insert Image: Example of a C2 Connection (e.g., Meterpreter session, Cobalt Strike beacon)_

# Privilege Escalation Preparation
At this stage, we will navigate through the system to locate sensitive information or stored passwords, preparing for the Actions on Objectives phase.

However, to gain full control and access critical data, administrator privileges are required.

ðŸ“Œ Insert Image: Running a command as a low-privilege user (e.g., whoami showing standard user)_

# Next Step: System Enumeration with WinPEAS
Prepare for system enumeration using WinPEAS to identify potential privilege escalation opportunities.

ðŸ“Œ Insert Image: Running WinPEAS and viewing privilege escalation opportunities_

## Best Places for Images
Command and Control Setup â†’ Show an image of an active C2 session.
Privilege Escalation Requirement â†’ Show proof of standard user access (whoami).
WinPEAS Enumeration â†’ Show output highlighting vulnerabilities.
