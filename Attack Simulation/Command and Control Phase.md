# Command and Control (C2)

### Objective: Establish communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.
### Techniques:
  - Using covert channels (e.g., DNS tunneling, encrypted HTTPS traffic).
  - Employing C2 servers to issue commands and exfiltrate data.

In this phase we are going to be moving through the machine to find sensitive information or passwords in order to be ready for the actions on objectives.

But to do this we need to have administrator privileges in order to have full control of the machine.
