# Phase 1: Reconnaissance

## ðŸŒŸ Objective:
Gather intelligence on the target, including email addresses and other publicly available information, to craft a convincing phishing attack.

### Steps:
#### Information Gathering:
- The attacker searches for the victimâ€™s LinkedIn profile.
- They obtain the victimâ€™s email address from LinkedIn.

#### Attack Planning:
- The attacker identifies the best social engineering tactic to use.
- Since the target is likely to trust emails from technical support, the attacker spoofs a tech support email.
- The phishing email will create a sense of urgency to pressure the victim into taking immediate action.

## Simulation Assumption
Since this is a controlled simulation, we will assume that we have successfully gathered all the necessary information to craft a malicious payload and phishing email.

## Creating a Temporary Email
To simulate the attack, we will use [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en) to generate a temporary email address. This will serve as the victimâ€™s email, which will receive the malicious email.
