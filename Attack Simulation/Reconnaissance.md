# Reconnaissance

## Objective:
Gather information about the target to prepare for an attack.

## Actions:

1. Utilize OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Techniques
 
    - Gather publicly available information about the target.

2. Identify Target’s Email Address
 
    - Assume we found the target’s email on Facebook by analyzing their public profile, posts, or comments.

3. Collect Additional Information
 
    - Gather details such as their job role, interests, or connections, which can be used to craft a convincing phishing email.

## Simulation Assumption
Since this is a controlled simulation, we will assume that we have successfully gathered all the necessary information to craft a malicious payload and phishing email.

## Creating a Temporary Email
To simulate the attack, we will use [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en) to generate a temporary email address. This will serve as the victim’s email, which will receive the malicious email.
