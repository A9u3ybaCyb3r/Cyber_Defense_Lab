## Planning Phase

First, we build the network architecture for the lab environment using [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/). This includes creating a detailed network diagram outlining the lab's structure, components, and connections. The diagram helps visualize how different elements interact, ensuring a well-organized setup for testing and security exercises.

## Changing VMware NAT Subnet Settings

This guide outlines the steps for configuring a NAT network in VMware Workstation Pro.

## Step 1: Open VMware Network Editor
1. Launch VMware Workstation Pro.
2. Go to the **Edit** menu and select **Virtual Network Editor**.
3. On macOS, it may be under **Preferences**.

## Step 2: Select the NAT Network
1. In the Virtual Network Editor, look for the **NAT (VMnet8)** network.
2. Select **VMnet8** from the list of virtual networks.

## Step 3: Change the Subnet IP
1. Click the **Change Settings** button (you may need administrative privileges to proceed).
2. In the NAT settings for **VMnet8**:
   - Locate the **Subnet IP** field (e.g., `192.168.1.0`).
   - Change it to your desired subnet, such as `10.19.19.0`.
   - Ensure the subnet mask is appropriate (usually `255.255.255.0` for `/24`).

## Step 4: Update the DHCP Settings (Optional)
If you want VMware to automatically assign IPs in the new subnet:
1. Click the **DHCP Settings** button.
2. Adjust the **Start IP Address** and **End IP Address** to match the new subnet range (e.g., `10.19.19.2` to `10.19.19.254`).

## Step 5: Save Changes
1. Click **OK** to save the changes in the Virtual Network Editor.
2. Close the editor.

## Step 6: Restart VMware Services
Restart the VMware NAT Service to apply the changes:
- **On Windows**:
   1. Open the **Services** app (type `services.msc` in the Start menu).
   2. Locate **VMware NAT Service** and **VMware DHCP Service**.
   3. Right-click each service and select **Restart**.
- **On macOS**, restart VMware Workstation.

## Step 7: Verify the Changes
1. Power on a virtual machine connected to the NAT network.
2. Check the assigned IP address using a command:
   - **On Linux**: `ifconfig` or `ip a`
   - **On Windows**: `ipconfig`
3. Confirm the IP address is in the new subnet range (e.g., `10.19.19.x`).

## Step 8: Test Connectivity
1. Ping the NAT gateway (e.g., `10.19.19.1`) to ensure proper routing.
2. Test internet access from the virtual machine to confirm NAT functionality.

---

**Note**: If you encounter any issues, ensure that your virtual machine is properly connected to the NAT network and that no firewall or network restrictions are blocking the connection.


## (On Virtualbox) Creating a New NAT Network in VirtualBox

---

## Installing Snort

1. Open a terminal and run:

	```bash
	sudo apt install snort

- Enter your password if prompted.

- During installation, Snort will ask for the local network address range. You can find this information using:

	```bash
	ifconfig

- Note your IP address and subnet mask. For example, if your IP is `192.168.1.4` and subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`, the network range is `192.168.1.0/24`.

2. Verify the installed version:

	```bash
	snort --version

3. Directory and Files Overview

- Configuration File: Located at `/etc/snort/snort.conf`. This file controls Snort's settings, including network variables and rules.

- Rules Directory: `/etc/snort/rules/` contains predefined rule files for detecting malicious activity.

4. Before making changes:

	```bash
	sudo cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf.bak

### Editing Configuration

1. Open the configuration file:

	```bash
	sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf

2. Set Network Variables:

- `HOME_NET`: Defines the monitored subnet. For example:

	```bash
	var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24

- `EXTERNAL_NET`: Defines the external network. Use:

	```bash
	var EXTERNAL_NET any

- Rule Configuration: Locate the rules section and ensure it points to your rule files:

	```bash
	include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
	include $RULE_PATH/backdoor.rules

### Testing Configuration:

1. Validate configuration changes using:

	```bash
	sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

- A successful test ensures that changes don't introduce errors.

2. Practical Usage:

- Sniffer Mode:

	```bash
	sudo snort -i <interface>

3. Displays captured packet headers.

- Packet Logger Mode: Stores packets in files for analysis.

- IDS/IPS Mode: Implements rule-based monitoring and prevention.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd238046-bd85-4cc5-b01c-67476542c7fb)


### Deploying Endpoint Agents

1. Define Logical Groupings with Installation Keys

- Navigate to the Installation Keys section in the LimaCharlie dashboard.

- Create installation keys based on endpoint categories. Examples:
   
   - Windows Lab Workstations: For Windows systems used in lab environments.
   
   - Linux Servers: For production or lab Linux servers.
   
   - Critical Infrastructure: For endpoints requiring log forwarding instead of direct agents.

- Use descriptive tags (e.g., ```workstations```, ```windows```, ```servers```) to simplify management and filtering.

2. Prepare Sensor Binaries

- Download the appropriate agent binary from the Sensor Download section. Ensure compatibility with the endpoint’s architecture and OS:
   
   - For Windows, download the ```Windows 64-bit``` executable.
   
   - For other systems (Linux, macOS, etc.), select the corresponding binary.

- Organize binaries for automated deployment to endpoints.

3. Centralized Deployment

- Integrate agent installation into endpoint provisioning pipelines:
   
   - Embed the sensor in baseline installation images for new endpoints.
   
   - Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, SCCM) to push the agent to existing endpoints.

- Ensure administrative privileges on target endpoints for successful agent installation.

4. Agent Installation

- Deploy the agent using the installation key to link it with the corresponding logical group:

  1. Open a terminal or PowerShell as an administrator on the endpoint.

  2. Execute the downloaded agent binary with the -i option followed by the installation key:

      ```cmd
      ./sensor_binary_name.exe -i <installation_key>
			
   - Confirm successful installation by verifying the agent appears under the Sensors List in the LimaCharlie dashboard.

5. Validate Deployment

- Check the Sensors List to ensure endpoints are properly registered.

- Verify telemetry data collection and connectivity.

- Perform a functional test using built-in commands like ```netstat``` via the Console feature to confirm operational status.

6. Post-Deployment Configuration

- Utilize the metadata provided in the dashboard to configure policies and detection rules for each endpoint group.

## Installing Sysmon

### 1. Download Sysmon
Sysmon is available from the Microsoft Sysinternals website:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

### 2. Obtain Configuration Files
Use community-supported configurations as a baseline for setup:

- [**SwiftOnSecurity's Sysmon Configuration**](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config): A high-quality default configuration.

- [**Olaf Hartong's Sysmon Modular**](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular): A modular and customizable approach.
  - **We will choose this one to send the logs to Splunk**.
  - Download the **sysmonconfig.xml** file

### 3. Install Sysmon

1. Extract the Sysmon executable from the downloaded package.
2. Run the installer with administrative privileges in PowerShell using a configuration file:

   ```powershell
   sysmon64.exe -i <config-file-path> -accepteula
   ```

   Replace `<config-file-path>` with the path to your chosen configuration file.

### 4. Verify Installation

1. **Check Running Services**:
   ```powershell
   net start
   ```

   Ensure the Sysmon service is listed as running.

2. **Confirm Sysmon Logs**:
   Open the Event Viewer and navigate to **Applications and Service Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational**
   - Verify that Sysmon is logging events as expected.
