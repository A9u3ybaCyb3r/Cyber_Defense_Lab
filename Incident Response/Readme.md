# Incident Response

In the Incident Response phase of the project, the goal is to effectively identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from the simulated phishing attack using the NIST Incident Response Framework. The framework guides the response process through its four stages, ensuring a systematic approach to handling cybersecurity incidents.

# NIST Incident Response Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It provides a flexible and comprehensive approach to improving the security and resilience of critical infrastructure and other systems.

## [Preparation](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Cyber_Defense_Lab/blob/main/Incident%20Response/Preparation.md)

This phase ensures readiness for potential incidents by implementing security measures and defining incident response protocols.

- **Set up monitoring tools**: Configure SIEM (Splunk), EDR (LimaCharlie), and IDS(Snort) for proactive detection.
- **Create detection rules**: Establish URL-based and behavior-based detection rules.
- **Baseline system behavior**: Understand normal network and endpoint activities.
- **Train incident response team**: Ensure SOC analysts are equipped to handle security incidents.

## [Detection and Analysis](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Cyber_Defense_Lab/blob/main/Incident%20Response/Detection%20and%20Analysis.md)

- Monitor for potential security incidents through logs, alerts, and reports.
- Identify and validate incidents using predefined criteria.
- Analyze the nature, scope, and impact of the incident.
- Document all findings for subsequent phases.

## [Containment, Eradication, and Recovery](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Cyber_Defense_Lab/blob/main/Incident%20Response/Containment%2C%20Eradication%2C%20and%20Recovery.md)

- **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage or spread.
- **Eradication**: Remove malicious artifacts, such as malware, and address vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
- **Recovery**: Restore systems to a known good state and verify their functionality.

## [Post-Incident Activity](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Cyber_Defense_Lab/blob/main/Incident%20Response/Post-Incident%20Activity.md)

- Conduct a post-mortem analysis to identify lessons learned.
- Update incident response policies and procedures based on insights.
- Share findings with relevant stakeholders to enhance organizational resilience.
